## 🔌 API Integration

### OpenAI DALL-E 3
```typescript
const response = await axios.post(
  'https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations',
  {
    model: 'dall-e-3',
    prompt: generatedPrompt,
    n: 1,
    size: '1024x1024',
    quality: 'standard',
  },
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
    },
  }
);
```

### Stable Diffusion (Replicate)
```typescript
const response = await axios.post(
  'https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions',
  {
    version: 'stability-ai/sdxl:latest',
    input: {
      prompt: generatedPrompt,
      negative_prompt: 'ugly, deformed, nsfw',
    },
  }
);
```

### Demo Fallback
Uses DiceBear API for free avatar generation when no API key:
```typescript
const demoUrl = `https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/bottts/svg?seed=${seed}`;
```

## 💾 Storage

### LocalStorage
Characters are saved to browser storage:
```typescript
localStorage.setItem('tutorCharacter', JSON.stringify(character));
```

Includes:
- SVG customization data
- AI-generated image URL
- Preference flag (use AI vs SVG)
- All metadata

### Future: Backend Storage
For production, images should be:
1. Uploaded to AWS S3 or similar
2. Character data saved to PostgreSQL
3. Image URLs referenced from database
