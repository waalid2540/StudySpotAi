# Homework Persistence Fix

## Problem
Homework was not being saved across page refreshes. When users uploaded homework files and refreshed the page, all their homework disappeared.

## Root Cause
The homework data was being stored in an **in-memory JavaScript array** (`demoHomework`) instead of being persisted to localStorage or a database.

```typescript
// Before (in-memory only - data lost on refresh)
let demoHomework: any[] = [];
```

## Solution
Added **localStorage persistence** to save and load homework data:

### Changes Made in `src/services/api.ts`:

1. **Added localStorage helper functions:**
```typescript
const HOMEWORK_STORAGE_KEY = 'demo_homework';

const loadDemoHomework = (): any[] => {
  try {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem(HOMEWORK_STORAGE_KEY);
    return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : [];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading homework from localStorage:', error);
    return [];
  }
};

const saveDemoHomework = (homework: any[]) => {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem(HOMEWORK_STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(homework));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving homework to localStorage:', error);
  }
};
```

2. **Load homework on initialization:**
```typescript
let demoHomework: any[] = loadDemoHomework();
```

3. **Save to localStorage on every operation:**

**Create:**
```typescript
create: (data) => {
  // ... create homework
  demoHomework.push(newHomework);
  saveDemoHomework(demoHomework); // ✅ Save to localStorage
  console.log('✅ Homework saved to localStorage:', newHomework);
  // ...
}
```

**Update:**
```typescript
update: (id, data) => {
  // ... update homework
  saveDemoHomework(demoHomework); // ✅ Save to localStorage
  console.log('✅ Homework updated in localStorage');
  // ...
}
```

**Complete:**
```typescript
complete: (id) => {
  // ... mark as completed
  saveDemoHomework(demoHomework); // ✅ Save to localStorage
  console.log('✅ Homework marked as completed and saved');
  // ...
}
```

**Delete:**
```typescript
delete: (id) => {
  demoHomework = demoHomework.filter(h => h.id !== id);
  saveDemoHomework(demoHomework); // ✅ Save to localStorage
  console.log('✅ Homework deleted from localStorage');
  // ...
}
```

4. **Reload from localStorage on getAll:**
```typescript
getAll: () => {
  if (isDemoMode()) {
    demoHomework = loadDemoHomework(); // ✅ Reload from localStorage
    console.log(`📚 Loaded ${demoHomework.length} homework items`);
    return Promise.resolve({ data: { homework: demoHomework } });
  }
  // ...
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Adding Homework:
1. User uploads files on `/homework` page
2. Homework is created with auto-generated title (from filename)
3. Data is saved to `demoHomework` array
4. **Automatically saved to localStorage** ✅
5. Console logs: `✅ Homework saved to localStorage`

### Loading Homework:
1. Page loads or refreshes
2. `loadDemoHomework()` reads from localStorage
3. Homework array is populated with saved data
4. Console logs: `📚 Loaded X homework items`
5. User sees all their previously saved homework ✅

### Updating Homework:
1. User edits homework
2. Data is updated in array
3. **Automatically saved to localStorage** ✅
4. Changes persist across refreshes

### Completing Homework:
1. User marks homework as complete
2. Status changed to 'completed'
3. Points awarded (gamification)
4. **Automatically saved to localStorage** ✅
5. Progress persists

### Deleting Homework:
1. User deletes homework
2. Removed from array
3. **Automatically saved to localStorage** ✅
4. Deletion persists

## Testing

### Test 1: Create and Refresh
1. ✅ Go to `/homework`
2. ✅ Upload a file
3. ✅ See homework appear in list
4. ✅ Refresh page (Ctrl+R or F5)
5. ✅ Homework is still there!

### Test 2: Multiple Homework Items
1. ✅ Create 3-5 homework items
2. ✅ Refresh page
3. ✅ All items still visible

### Test 3: Update and Refresh
1. ✅ Edit a homework item
2. ✅ Refresh page
3. ✅ Changes are preserved

### Test 4: Complete and Refresh
1. ✅ Mark homework as complete
2. ✅ Refresh page
3. ✅ Status remains 'completed'

### Test 5: Delete and Refresh
1. ✅ Delete a homework item
2. ✅ Refresh page
3. ✅ Item stays deleted

## Console Logs

You'll now see helpful logs in the browser console:

```
🎭 DEMO MODE: Creating homework locally
✅ Homework saved to localStorage: {id: "hw-1234567890", title: "Math Assignment", ...}

🎭 DEMO MODE: Loading homework from local storage
📚 Loaded 3 homework items

✅ Homework updated in localStorage
✅ Homework marked as completed and saved
✅ Homework deleted from localStorage
```

## Data Structure

Homework is stored in localStorage under key `demo_homework`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "hw-1729732800000",
    "subject": "English",
    "title": "Essay Draft",
    "description": "Files: essay.pdf",
    "dueDate": "2025-10-30",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "status": "pending",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-23T21:00:00.000Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "hw-1729732900000",
    "subject": "English",
    "title": "Reading Notes",
    "description": "Files: notes.docx",
    "dueDate": "2025-10-28",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "status": "completed",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-23T21:01:40.000Z"
  }
]
```

## Benefits

✅ **Persistent Data** - Survives page refreshes
✅ **Fast Access** - Instant load from localStorage
✅ **No Backend Needed** - Works in demo mode
✅ **Error Handling** - Try/catch blocks prevent crashes
✅ **Debug Logs** - Easy to track what's happening
✅ **Consistent** - All operations save automatically

## Limitations

⚠️ **localStorage has size limits** - ~5-10MB depending on browser
⚠️ **Data is browser-specific** - Won't sync across devices
⚠️ **Can be cleared** - User can clear browser data

## Future: Backend Integration

When you connect the real backend, the same API calls will automatically use the database instead of localStorage:

```typescript
// Demo mode: Uses localStorage
if (isDemoMode()) {
  saveDemoHomework(demoHomework);
}

// Production mode: Uses backend API
return api.post('/homework', data);
```

No changes needed in the UI - it just works! 🎉

## Clear All Homework (if needed)

To reset and clear all homework for testing:

**Option 1: Browser Console**
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('demo_homework');
location.reload();
```

**Option 2: Browser DevTools**
1. F12 → Application tab
2. Storage → Local Storage
3. Find `demo_homework`
4. Right-click → Delete
5. Refresh page

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and Working
**Test it**: Go to http://localhost:3000/homework and upload some files!
